# Manchester HacSpace - PCB2GCode

In order to create PCB's using the CNC or laser cutter ideally we need ether a SVG Output (for the laser) or G-Code list of commands (for the CNC)
There are several different applications available to do this.

## PCB2GCode

This application is open source and seems to have had the most recent attention from a development point of view.
It accepter gerber files and generates G-Code Files that can be used with a CNC

TODO I'd really like to get the SVG output option working for the Laser Cutter

## Rapid-PCB

This tool seems to be online only but can be used to generate G-Code from gerber files

## PCB-GCode

PCB-GCode appears to be one of the older tools originaly developed for generating G-Code from Eagle Files.
However it only appears to work with Eagle, not with Gerber files or KiCad. The last version released was 04/11/2014
