## Pcb2gcode

The version of Pcb2gcode located here was built via MSYS2 so you may need to install MSYS2 under windows in order to run this.
Also there's a version of Pcb2gcodeGUI included in the same directory, this may require the installation of QT Libraries under windows in order to work

## FlatCam.grbd

This is a copy of the latest version of FlatCam, including my pull request for svg exports for use with the laser cutter
It looks like the pull request has been accepted now so this should be in the master branch of

  * http://flatcam.org/
  * https://bitbucket.org/jpcgt/flatcam

In order to run, just run FlatCAM.py from within the build directory

It was then pulled down, and the source code was uploaded to <https://github.com/nikropht/FreeRouting> <br>

The best version I've found with pre-built binaries is the following

I've uploaded a copy here for convenience
